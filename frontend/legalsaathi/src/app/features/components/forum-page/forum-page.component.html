                    My landlord is trying to increase the rent halfway through a 12-month lease. The lease agreement doesn't mention anything about this. Is this legal? How should I approach this situation?

                    I ordered a kitchen appliance from an online store, but it arrived damaged. The company says they won't issue a refund or replacement because I didn't report the issue within 24 hours. What are my options to resolve this?

                    I recently moved to another city for a job, but my ex is now challenging our custody arrangement, claiming the move isn't in our child's best interest. Has anyone faced a similar situation? How did you handle it?

                    I've been struggling financially and missed filing taxes for two years. Now I'm worried about the penalties and how to catch up. Can I negotiate with the tax department, or is it too late?

                    My employer confronted me about a social media post I made outside of work hours, claiming it violates company policy. Can they take disciplinary action based on my personal social media activity? Is this legal?
